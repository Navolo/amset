.. title:: AMSET: ab initio scattering and transport

AMSET: *ab initio* scattering and transport
===========================================

Introduction
------------

Accurately calculating electronic transport properties from first-principles
is often highly computationally expensive and difficult to perform. AMSET is a
fast and easy-to-use package to model carrier transport. The primary aim of
AMSET is to be **amenable to high-throughput screenings**. Features of AMSET
include:

- All inputs easily obtainable from first-principles calculations. The
  primary input for AMSET is an *ab initio* uniform band structure.
- Scattering rates approximated based on common materials properties
  such as phonon frequencies and dielectric constants.
- Transport properties calculated by solving the iterative Boltzmann transport
  equation.
- Heavily optimised code that can run on a personal laptop. High-performance
  computing clusters are not necessary.

AMSET is built on top of state-of-the-art open-source libraries: BoltzTraP2
for band structure interpolation, numpy and scipy to enable high-performance, and
pymatgen for handling DFT calculation data.

*Note: Currently, AMSET is best integrated with VASP, however,
support for additional periodic DFT codes will be added in the future.*

Scattering Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The scattering mechanisms currently implemented in AMSET are:

- Acoustic deformation potential scattering.
- Ionized impurity scattering.
- Polar optical phonon scattering.
- Piezoelectric scattering.

More information on the formalism for each scattering mechanism is available
in the `theory section <theory>`_ of the documentation.
