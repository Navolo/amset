# AMSET

Ab initio Model for Mobility and Seebeck coefficient using Boltzmann Transport equation. AMSET (a.k.a aMoBT) in Python is currently in development and is not functional. If you are intereted in the MATLAB source code of the basic model (aMoBT), please contact alireza@lbl.gov; the basic model is not appropriate for anisotropic or multiple-valley band structures.
