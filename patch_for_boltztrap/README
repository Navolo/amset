This patch is meant to edit the BoltzTraP code in order to get a file containg
the coefficients of the interpolation and other data useful to interpolate the
band structure inside AMSET.

This is an example code to get the original BoltzTraP version and apply this patch.

wget https://owncloud.tuwien.ac.at/index.php/s/s2d55LYlZnioa3s/download -O Boltztrap.tar.gz

tar xf Boltztrap.tar.gz

cp patch.diff boltztrap-1.2.5/

cd boltztrap-1.2.5/

patch -p0 < patch.diff

This should be the correct output:
patching file src/BoltzTraP.F90
patching file src/m_bandstructure.F90

Then it is possible to continue with the compilation of the BoltzTraP code
according its documentation.
